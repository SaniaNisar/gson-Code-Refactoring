Here is a detailed list of all the refactorings made across the 4 files based on your checklist, without changing the intent of the code:

✅ 1. Structural Refactoring
Moved each adapter into its own class/file under sql.adapters package:

SqlDateTypeAdapter

SqlTimeTypeAdapter

SqlTimestampTypeAdapter

SqlTypesSupport

Introduced a new abstract base class BaseSqlDateAdapter<T> to centralize shared logic (e.g., date formatting/parsing, error handling).

✅ 2. Thread Safety Improvements
Replaced synchronized blocks with:

java
Copy
Edit
private final ThreadLocal<DateFormat> threadLocalFormat = 
    ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SimpleDateFormat(FORMAT));
This ensures SimpleDateFormat is now thread-safe per instance.

✅ 3. Extract Constants
Hardcoded date/time format strings (e.g., "MMM d, yyyy", "hh:mm:ss a") were moved to:

java
Copy
Edit
private static final String DATE_FORMAT = "MMM d, yyyy";
private static final String TIME_FORMAT = "hh:mm:ss a";
private static final String TIMESTAMP_FORMAT = "MMM d, yyyy hh:mm:ss a";
✅ 4. Common Base Class
Created BaseSqlDateAdapter<T extends Date>:

Encapsulates common methods: write(...), read(...)

Takes ThreadLocal<DateFormat> and Class<T> as constructor params

Reduces duplication and simplifies each adapter class

✅ 5. Error Handling Enhancements
Enhanced JsonSyntaxException messages with context:

java
Copy
Edit
throw new JsonSyntaxException(
    String.format("Error parsing SQL %s '%s' at path %s",
        type.getSimpleName(), dateString, in.getPreviousPath()), e);
✅ 6. Modularization / Optional Module Support
SqlTypesSupport:

Remains a clean utility for registering adapters

Now uses clear naming like registerSqlTypeAdapters(...)

Optional SQL dependency handling remains intact

✅ 7. Documentation & Naming
Renamed vague variables:

s → dateString

in, out → kept as-is where context is clear

Renamed FACTORY to more descriptive constants:

SQL_DATE_FACTORY

SQL_TIME_FACTORY

SQL_TIMESTAMP_FACTORY

Added/Improved JavaDocs on each class and method (brief summaries only for now)

✅ 8. Dependency Injection (Advanced)
Instead of hardcoding new SimpleDateFormat(...) in method bodies:

Date formatters are passed through constructor using ThreadLocal<DateFormat>

Allows test-time injection and format flexibility

✅ 9. Testability and Readiness for Unit Tests
Each class is now modular, predictable, and testable

Can easily test:

Valid/invalid parsing

Thread-safety (by checking multiple threads access the same instance)


Here’s a brief overview of each class in your refactored design and how they collaborate with each other based on the class diagram:

1. SqlTypesSupport
Role: Central utility class that registers all SQL TypeAdapter factories.

Responsibilities:

Holds references to all SQL-related TypeAdapter factories.

Provides conditional registration (e.g., only register if java.sql.* is available).

Collaboration:

Uses SqlDateTypeAdapter, SqlTimeTypeAdapter, and SqlTimestampTypeAdapter factories to add to GsonBuilder.

2. BaseSqlDateAdapter<T extends Date>
Role: Abstract base class to consolidate shared logic between different SQL date/time adapters.

Responsibilities:

Holds the ThreadLocal<DateFormat> for thread-safe parsing/formatting.

Provides shared read and write methods for subclasses.

Collaboration:

Extended by all specific adapters: SqlDateTypeAdapter, SqlTimeTypeAdapter, and SqlTimestampTypeAdapter.

3. SqlDateTypeAdapter
Role: Handles conversion between java.sql.Date and JSON.

Responsibilities:

Inherits parsing/formatting logic from BaseSqlDateAdapter.

Implements factory for registering with Gson.

Collaboration:

Registered through SqlTypesSupport.

4. SqlTimeTypeAdapter
Role: Converts java.sql.Time to/from JSON.

Responsibilities:

Uses a thread-safe time format ("hh:mm:ss a").

Implements its own TypeAdapter factory.

Collaboration:

Registered by SqlTypesSupport.

5. SqlTimestampTypeAdapter
Role: Handles conversion for java.sql.Timestamp.

Responsibilities:

Uses shared base logic via BaseSqlDateAdapter.

Parses JSON strings into Timestamp and formats them back.

Collaboration:

Registered in SqlTypesSupport.

Collaboration Summary
All adapter classes (Date, Time, Timestamp) are responsible for (de)serializing specific SQL time types.

These adapters extend a shared base (BaseSqlDateAdapter) to reduce duplication.

SqlTypesSupport acts as a central class that brings these adapters together for Gson configuration.
